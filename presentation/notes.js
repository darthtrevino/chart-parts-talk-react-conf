	composableLibrariesTaxonomic: `
    One thing you'll notice is that to varying degrees, their APIs are taxonomic${line}
    
    What this means is that${line}
    ${bulletab}the element API reflects a fixed set of chart-types${line}
    ${bulletab}these might be composable, and you can do really interesting things with that${line}
    ${bulletab}but it's kind of like using pre-made sentences to express our language instead of words${line}

    ${bulletab}These are the composable elements we use to put charts together${line}
    
    ${separator}
    And on the right, here's Recharts' top-level API${line}
    ${bulletab}The kinds of components you can use in these charts is determined by the kind of top-level chart you have${line}
    ${end}
  `,

	coupledToRendering: `
  Another issue we run into is that we're often coupled to a specific rendering technology${line}
  
  ${separator}
  In Victory, this means we can dynamically add elements to our chart.${line}
  ${bulletab}In this piece of code, an Area chart is rendered with an adjaced circle by thunking down to raw SVG${line}
  ${bulletab}This gives us pretty nice flexibility, if the abstraction is a little leaky${line}

  ${separator}
  In react-vis, this means that for each component type we're interested in
  ${bulletab}there's a canvas implementation and an svg implementation${line}
  ${bulletab}which may be a little weird, and the raw svg approach from the victory example would be brittle${line}

  ${separator}
  In any of these libraries, and in most charting libraries in general, this means that we are solidly coupled 
  to the DOM.${line}

  This is one of the reasons why getting parity on mobile using React-Native is such a pain in the ass${line}
 ${bulletab}Only victory has any kind of mobile library at all${line}
 ${bulletab}And it requires you to use a separate library${line}
 ${bulletab}Which means that the raw svg tricks we're using will not work there${line}
 ${bulletab}Or we have to adapt it to use whatever rendering technology is backing it${line}
  ${end}
  `,

	diyDataflow: `
  One final thing we see is that we are responsible for bringing our own data operations${line}

  For simple charts' this isn't a big deal. But if we have a complex chart with a lot of${line}
  ${bulletab}data filtering, statistical computations, or data faceting${line}
  ${bulletab}this starts to get a little hairier${line}
  ${bulletab}especially if these things interact dynamically and we want to be performant${line}

  `,

	victoryTaxonomical: `
  Their API for charting elements is kind of taxonomical in nature. ${line}
  What that means is that each Victory component is basically a different kind of chart${line} 
  And the language we use to express our own charts is kind of limited by kinds of chart types they provide${line}
  
  Some libraries, even the theory-grounded ones, provide a catalogue of chart types instead of low-level primitives.${line}
  They still work well, but it's analogous to talking in prebuilt sentences instead of words.${line}

  There's no reason these can't co-exist together.${line}
  One pretty normal concept is to build terser, higher abstractions on top of lower abstractions${line}
  which gives us the flexibility to glissade between those different modes of expression${line}
 
  ${end}
  `,

	gogFront: `
  One idea that we've heard about, being adjacent to well-read visualization researchers is that of the "Grammar of Graphics".${line}
  It's an idea that we've found kind of exciting and satisfies a lot of our expressibility wants${line}

  ${end}
  `,

	gogWalk: `
  ${separator}  
  This idea originated in 1999 with the publication a book titled "The Grammar of Graphics" by Leland Wilkinson, 
  who's a well-know visualization researcher${line}
  These ideas have a handful of implementations, in various programming ecosystems${line}

  ${separator}

  The grammar of graphics is named so, because it envisions an system of object-oriented system object-oriented 
  charting elements that operate together to form a cohesive chart.${line}
  These elements are analogous to words used together in sentences, syntactically and semantically, to convey meaning.${line}

  ${separator}
  
  These elements consist of the basic pieces of charts we're all familiar with:${line}
  ${bulletab}data transformation elements for things like aggregation, statistics, and layout computes<br/>
  ${bulletab}data scales to map your data to view boundaries or to colors<br/>
  ${bulletab}coordinate systems for drawing shapes<br/>
  ${bulletab}shapes to draw<br/>
  ${bulletab}and guide components for things like axes and legends${line}

  ${separator}
  
  As an example, say we have a rectangle component, 
  and we want to encode an instance of it into our chart in cartesian space${line}
  This rectangle will encoded parameters for its ${line}
  ${bulletab}x,y start position${line}
  ${bulletab}width and height${line}
  ${bulletab}and a color.${line}

  ${separator}
  
  Now this is basically how components work${line}
  ${bulletab}we parameterize elements that encapsulate behavior of some kind.${line}
  ${bulletab}They may or may not interact with each other to coordinate their functional behavior.${line}
  ${bulletab}And we compose them in our applications to express something that solves a problem for us.
  ${end}
  `,

	gogPhases: `
  In Wilkinson's book, the grammar-of-graphics is described by a specification language, and then charts are created by working through a process.${line}
  
  Nhe main phases of creating charts using the Grammar of Graphics are described as:${line}

  ${separator}
  First, specify a scene using chart-element components. This specification contains a lot of moving parts, and not all of them are visual.${line}
  ${bulletab}This includes data inputs${line}
  ${bulletab}data transformations and statistical aggregations${line}
  ${bulletab}scale definitions${line}
  ${bulletab}coordinate systems such as cartesian or polar${line}
  ${bulletab}rendered shapes or elements${line}
  ${bulletab}and defining any guides such as axes and legends.${line}

  ${separator}
  Next, we need to assemble an abstract scenegraph.${line}
  ${bulletab}This means taking our data sources${line}
  ${bulletab}flowing them through our specification${line}
  ${bulletab}and emitting a resultant scene that expresses a abstract notion of a chart.${line}

  It's important that this scenegraph is abstract, because it gives us the ability to use the same scenegraph 
  and specification language on different platforms.${line}
  
  You could consider SVG or DOM a scenegraph specification, but they're coupled to technology, and to the browser.${line}

  ${separator}

  And lastly, we render the scenegraph out into whatever output our system supports.${line}

  ${separator}
  If you squint just a little bit, this process looks a lot like the process of a compiler.${line}
  And the abstract scenegraph plays the same role as the abstract syntax tree does for compilers${line}
  
  In compilers${line}
  ${bulletab}the front-end is work before the scenegraph, turning your program specification into a generic tree of instructions${line}
  ${bulletab}and the back-end turns that abstract specification into bits for your computer${line}
  ${bulletab}This allows compiler users to be able to switch languages or target environments fairly easily without needing a whole system from scratch.${line}
  
  ${end}
  `,

	dataflowProblem: `
  In the grammar of graphics, we're not just dealing with rendered view elements, there's also a system of
  filtering, statistical aggregations, data faceting, and general data manipulation, that helps to form our language of specification.${line}

  A feature you may see in Grammar of Graphics implementations is a dataflow graph.${line}
  
  A dataflow graph is a way of describing data transforms as a pipeline of processing nodes.${line}
  Each node can augment, aggregate, or cull data from our source data tables.${line}
  Ideally, they can perform these computations progressively, so that we can support progressive rendering by using streaming data sources${line}
  Or we can respond efficiently to filtering and pivoting operations.${line}

  ${separator}

  So the way these things work, you describe a network of transform nodes that are dependent on each other's output,${line}
  ${bulletab}pump your data into the input nodes${line}
  ${bulletab}and your rendering elements use what comes out on the other side${line}
  ${bulletab}it can even extend beyond this point with data faceting${line}
  ${bulletab}and data operations that dovetail with view specification${line}

  ${separator}

  This is still kind of an open problem in component-land.${line}
  The Vega project, which we'll see in a minute, features a data transform graph as a key concept, but it's difficult to use outside of Vega.${line}  
  
  It would be nice if we could express this at the component level - maybe something that's based on Observables and emerging signal-graph work.${line} 

  Something like this would benefit every Javascript charting library.
  ${end}
  `,

	gogImpls: `
  So this is a cool idea, it fits nicely with our component-based way of thinking. ${line}
  What are our options for implementations of this?${line}
  `,

	showcaseVegaPage: `
  If you're in Python or R, you have ggplot and altair, which are widely used${line}
  But we're javascript developers${line}
  And being Javascript people, the 800lb gorilla, the primary implementation, is Vega${line}
  
  ${separator}
  We first learned about the Grammar of Graphics from a talk that Dominik Moretz gave at our campus where he introduced Vega-Lite${line}

  Vega comes in two flavors, Vega and Vega Lite. ${line}
  They're part of the same ecosystem, but with different goals${line}
  Vega is a lower level abstraction on orchestrating scales and primitives${line}
  And Vega-Lite is a higher-level abstraction for making charts that look good and follow best practices${line}
  To lean on the grammar analogy a bit, Vega is concerned with Syntax - the structure of when words can be used.${line}
  And vega-lite is concened with semantics - how can we make words that make sense together${line}

  ${separator}
  In both of these libraries though${line}
  ${bulletab}you author your visuals using static JSON${line}
  ${bulletab}and the whole thing is a closed-off, seamless unit.${line}  
  
  This is great for transform and sharing scenarios, but it makes authoring them kind of difficult.${line}
  Let's look at how you'd write some charts in Vega.
  ${end}
  `,

	vegaBarChart: `
    Vega in practice is like a super structured d3.${line}
    So there's a little bit of plumbing that goes along with it.${line}
    
    To start, we need to set our chart options,${line}
    ${bulletab}here's where we'd select what renderer to use - svg or canvas,
    ${bulletab}the background color of the chart${line}
    ${bulletab}and the dimensions and padding to use${line}
    ${bulletab}axes will stretch that size out, so be careful of that.${line}

    ${separator}

    Next, we wire in our data tables.${line}
    ${bulletab}Each table has a name${line}
    ${bulletab}And it consists of an array of objects${line}
    ${bulletab}and either a static definition like we have here or a URL.${line}

    You can also define data transformation steps that will perform aggregation or layout transform on the input data.${line}
    This is the start of the vega-dataflow pipeline.${line}

    ${separator}

    Next we'll define some event handling. This sets up an internal "signaling system".${line}

    We haven't talked about signals yet, but in Vega,${line}
    ${bulletab}signals are basically a set of named variables that the charts cand bind to${line}
    ${bulletab}and update when interactions happen${line}

    It's basically like an embedded, declarative Redux${line}

    When you instantiate this in JS, there's an API on the view object Vega gives you that will let you ${line}
    ${bulletab}subscribe to changes and ${line}
    ${bulletab}mutate them externally.${line}

    ${separator}

    Next you define your scales, which should be a familiar concept if you've used d3.${line}
    Scales are how we map your data to UI dimensions, such as width, height, and coloring parameters.${line}
    Each scale here is a named object so we can reference it later${line}

    ${separator}
    Then we'll define our axis components, oriented to the edges of our view-space${line}
    The axis won't land in the scenegraph, but it's a higher-order component that spits out low-level scenegraph elements${line}
    When we talk about being able to glissade between low-level rendering and high-level orchestration, axes are a prime example${line}

    ${separator}
    Finally, we'll define our visual components.${line}
    ${bulletab}We can bind these to a table; this will cause one mark to be emitted per row in the data table.${line}
    ${bulletab}And the attributes of each marks can be bound to a data/scale combination ${line} 
    ${bulletab}Or to static values ${line}
    ${end}  
  `,

	vegaBarChartLive: `
  And now we have a bar-chart in Vega.${line}

  There's some component-based thinking going on within Vega.${line}
  It provides individual components such as scales, axes, marks and legends that are configured either statically or in a data-bound way.${line}
  And it's incredibly expressive and can describe a broad variety of charts${line}

  But a declarative JSON-based API like that is kind of a pain to work with.${line}
  You don't have great debugging seams, and it can be difficult to reason about the
  structure of a chart. This is only exacerbated as the complexity of a chart grows.${line}
  
  You can imagine that as our charts grow in complexity,${line}
  and we start introducing complex transformation graphs and signaling${line}
  and then make it a closed system that you can't debug easily${line}
  and you end up with something that's kind of difficult to reason about${line}

  We really like the ideas here, but prefer the ergonomics of the composable charting libraries we looked at before.${line}

	whatif: `
  So our question, since first learning about Vega, and trying to integrate it into our own React applications, has been - what if were were to have access to Vega's abstraction level,${line}

  So I'll start off with some caveats - this is only used and developed by my team at the moment, and it's in very nascent stages${line}
  Don't expect vscode or typescript level support${line}
  `,

	chartPartsArchitectureBackend: `
  We started out by using vega's scenegraph.${line}
  Their specification is built out into a scenegraph json object that's then drawn out using your selected renderer.${line}

  We started with these objects and built a transform pipeline out into React virtual-dom. This piece of the library came up really quickly: 
  we made a few transformation functions that turn this scenegraph into a pseodo-svg model, and then that model into React-Dom-based SVG.${line}

  By leaning on React's reconciliation algorithm, we've been able to avoid dealing with DOM updates in response to scenegraph changes.${line}

  This will probably change in the future, especially as we start taking a hard look at how to resolve some performance issues, 
  but it was encouraging to see that part happen quickly${line}

  This technique also allows us to wire in react event handlers in our chart components' eventing, which makes them feel normal in a React appliaction.

	chartPartsArchitectureFrontend: `
  The specification of charts is done via our component layer. We use renderless components, which do not emit any actual DOM, but instead interact with 
  APIs as they mount. We learned about this technique from a talk Ken Wheeler gave at react-europe, and it's worked out really well, and it's had some interesting ramifications.${line}
  
  First, although our library is kind of designed around our use case of using react, it's not tightly coupled to it. 
  We made a scene-specification API that our Renderless layer is interacting with. So if React ever goes the way of Angular 1, we don't necessarily lose everything</br></br>

  And second, because there's no tacit structure between renderless components, you can combine them any way you want and insert fragments and functional components anywhere in your 
  chart structure. ${line}
  This means that you have a way of managing structural complexity using your own named components
  ${end}
  `,

	chartPartsArchitectureDropout: `
  One interesting thing about this technique is that if you look at the flow of when things are in "react-land" vs when they are in vanilla Javascript land, 
  we're only in React-land at the very beginning and end of chart construction.${line}

  Everything between those points is data binding into a scenegraph and the scenegraph being transformed into virtual-dom.
  `,

	chartPartsBarChart: `
  Let's take a look at what our API looks like.${line}
  
  So first, we're going to import our charting components. In this case we need a top-level chart, axes, a rectangle and some scales.${line}
  
  Next we'll pick a renderer. Right now we have an React SVG and a React-Native-SVG renderer, but we're considering adding one for PIXI as well.${line}

  Next we set up a top-level chart. Here's where we'll set top-level values such as the width, height, padding, the renderer, and data tables for the chart${line}

  And next we'll define some scales. Scales in chart-parts are independent components that can be referenced by other components${line}

  Each scale has a name, which we'll use to reference from the drawn components.${line}

  And we can bind it to a domain of the source data. Any lodash expression will work${line}
  
  We can also bind it to a view dimension. As we build complex charts, these view dimensions could be a subsection of the top-level chart, 
  and so this will allow us to map to those dimensions. As we add axes, this will exclude that space as well${line}

  Next we'll add Axis components, anchored to an edge of the viewspace and bound to a scale. These can also be customized with tick label formatting, tick counts, etc..${line}
  
  And finally, we'll define our drawn element.${line}

  We can bind to a data table in our dataset. For each row in that data table we'll emit a rectangle into our scenegraph${line}
  If we're not bound to a table, this only renders a single instance, and the context would contain whatever datum the parent was bound to.${line}

  Here's how we encode attributes of the drawn elements. We define an encoding function for each attribute of the element we want to set. 
  This encoding function is has a single parameter: a context object containing the current view size, the named scales and data tables, the datum being rendered, and the index it appears at.${line}

  We can also encode them as static values that don't modulate based on data. ${line}

  And finally, we can add event handlers for any event fired by the rendered view elements. We wanted to be able to integrate these charts into apps we were building, so we wanted to 
  be able to opt-out of the built-in signal system that Vega has and handle our own events and state management.${line}
  `,

	managingComplexity: `
  I've mentioned that Renderless Components have given us a way to manage complexity in our chart. The reason for that is that there is no tacit parent/child relationship between our elements.${line}

  In some charting libraries, you'll see that there's some boilerplate work done to ensure that only valid child components are used, and that kind of precludes the ability to insert your own abstraction.${line}

  Since renderless components orchestrate api interactions under the hood, and the nodes in our specification graph all have the same kinds of elements, we can organize these using Function Components pretty easily${line}
  `,

	barChartSFC: `
  In this code snippet, we're taking the same bar chart, but we're going to slice it up a little. This is a trivial example, but it demonstrates the idea.${line}
  We have custom components that encapsulate our scale and axis components, and below we have function components that define those elements.
  `,

	composability: `
  The flexibility afforded to us by renderless components also allows us to compose and augment charting elements in a very fluid way.  
  `,
	composabilityCode: `
  So let's try to add that mean line element we were talking about in our example before ${line}
  ${separator}

  First, let's define our meanline component.${line}
  The Rule type will draw a line instance.${line}
  We can now define a new component for our meanLine.${line}
  You'll notice that we're not binding this to a table, so it will render as a singleton instance. ${line}
  The x parameters will use the current view bounds, so it it will be the full width of the chart. ${line}
  This lets us avoid having to define a new scale, since our X scale is categorical.${line}
  And the y value will be the computed mean of the data.${line}

  ${separator}

  And to render this into our chart, we'll extend our barchart component so that it will render child elements.${line}
  We could use render props if we wanted, and that would be great for more complex situations where we want to include elements at different parts of a specification graph,${line}
  but in this case this will give us the effect we want${line}

  And then we simply render the children elements into the chart.${line}
  
  `,

	composableComposed: `
  Now we have the basic elements that we want, and we can compose them pretty easily.${line}
  Now we're dealing with exactly the abstraction level we want - we can make meaningful component types out of our system of primitives.
  `,

	accessibility: `
  Now let's talk about accessibility. It's not normally something we consider when writing visualizations, since we normally assume that our 
  users are sighted.${line}

  But SVG does support aria tags, and by using them in our charts, we can tell the same data stories to users who are visually impaired and use screen-readers${line}
  
  This is an area that probably needs some good feedback, and it only works with our web SVG renderer, but here's our current take on it:
  ${line}
  `,

	accessibilityCode: `
  First off, we can add aria description and title tags to our chart at the top level. This would give screen reader users a high-level description of what 
  the chart is about${line}

  Next, we can encode tab indexes into our marks - this will allow screen-reader users to use keyboard navigation through elements in the chart and navigate them in sequence.${line}

  And finally we can add aria tags to individual mark elements. We can encode them like any other parameter to let them reflect the data this mark is bound to.
  `,

	accessibleLiveChart: `
  TURN ON CHROMEVOX${line}

  And now we can tab through our chart and hear descriptions of all the important data points
  `,

	mobile: `
  Now, by virtue of being scenegraph-based, we can change the target rendering technology to whatever we want, 
  provided that we have an implementation of the renderer.${line}
  
  Our react renderer is just emitting React virtual-dom, and one nice thing about this means that we can emit 
  react-native virtual-dom instead, and very easily have parity between native and mobile (at least in Javascript) 
  ${end}  
  `,

	mobileCode: `
  We just switch our rendere to the react-native rendere, and we can run on mobile devices.
  ${line}
  
  Our react-native-svg renderer is using the component types from react-native-svg to easily implement our charts on 
  mobile devices.

  ${end}
  `,

	showcaseWinchester: `
  And with that, we've solved our problem, and the pint is back on.
   `,

	conclusion: `
  And that's about it!${line}
  
  I'm not going to try and sell you on the idea that our charting library is the best one you can use. 
  They all involve various engineering, stylistic, performance and theoretical tradeoffs.${line}

  But I hope you try it out and give us some feedback${line}

  But even if you decide not to, I hope you found this helpful in being able to discriminate about some different aspects of charts that maybe
  you haven't thought of before. I hope you'll gravitate towards composable, flexible libraries intead of brittle ones. ${line}

  If you're thinking about making your own charting library - I hope you'll lean towards composable primitive elements and then build taxonomical 
  elements on top of those, and that you'll let your users mix and match them.${line}
